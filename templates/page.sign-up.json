            "paragraph": "To produce P24, we use a highly controlled fermentation process that starts with inserting the enzyme’s gene into E. coli, a common host in biotech manufacturing. The bacteria are grown in nutrient-rich broth, and enzyme production is triggered using a lactose-based induction system. This method allows us to ensure high yields and consistent quality. Every step is carefully monitored to maintain purity and performance from the start."

            "paragraph": "One of the most remarkable traits of P24 is its ability to purify itself. As a protease, it breaks down surrounding proteins from the fermentation process, eliminating the need for traditional purification methods like chromatography or crystallization. Its natural acid stability also helps remove unwanted bacterial fragments, making the process faster, simpler, and cleaner. This means fewer processing steps — and a purer enzyme for you."
